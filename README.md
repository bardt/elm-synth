# Elm Synth

## Motivation

This is an experiment in how can be Web Audio API used from Elm program.

First intention was to create some sort of declarative API for Audio API. Naive implementation is here, but I plan to migrate to some of existing solutions, like [web-audio-assembler](https://github.com/danigb/web-audio-assembler) or [virtual-audio-graph](https://github.com/benji6/virtual-audio-graph). 

Anyway, I plan to add a visual UI corresponding to Audio API terms.

## Development

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app). Manual is [here](https://github.com/bardt/elm-synth/blob/master/ELM_APP_README.md)
