# Elm Synth

## Motivation

This is an experiment in how can Web Audio API be used from Elm program.

First intention was to create some sort of declarative API for Audio API. Now, the project is migrated to [virtual-audio-graph](https://github.com/benji6/virtual-audio-graph).

Upcoming work will focus on:
- Experimenting with API on the Elm side.
- Preparing this API to become a separate package, accompanied with [virtual-audio-graph](https://github.com/benji6/virtual-audio-graph) JavaScript package and instructions how to set it all up.
- Visual improvements and clearing the UI.

## Development

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app). Manual is [here](https://github.com/bardt/elm-synth/blob/master/ELM_APP_README.md)
